    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Bundt cake (/b ånt/) is a cake that is baked in a Bundt pan, shaping it into a distinctive doughnut shape. 
            The shape is inspired by a traditional European cake known as Gugelhupf, but Bundt cakes are not generally 
            associated with any single recipe. The style of mold in North America was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s, 
            after cookware manufacturer Nordic Ware trademarked the name "Bundt" and began producing Bundt pans from cast aluminum. 
            Publicity from Pillsbury saw the cakes gain widespread popularity.</p>
